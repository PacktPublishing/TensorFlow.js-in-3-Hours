# TensorFlow.js in 3 Hours [Video]
This is the code repository for [TensorFlow.js in 3 Hours [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/tensorflowjs-3-hours-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838824587), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this course, you will go through the process of learning how to use Tensorflow.js in a variety of the most popular deep learning tasks and use it in your own web browser.

You will start by learning how to classify images using commonly used Convolutional Neural Networks. And to get up and running fast you will use a pre-trained model to do that. Then you will jump into exploring yet another popular deep learning architecture called Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network. This time to classify text typed by a user in a real-time. You will discover how to work with audio data using a specific type of CNN. You will then jump into methods to improve the results of our models by firstly looking at transfer learning. Here you will improve the performance of your model quickly by using a pre-trained model as a base and perform short, focused training. 

By the end of this course, you will have the skills to use Tensorflow.js and train your own personal models using only a web browser.
