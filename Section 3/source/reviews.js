instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as " powerful " or " touching " .
i have a name for it myself : " gross " .
this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the " rebel " threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too .
how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being " inspired " by something like that ?
this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence .
instinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa .
he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him .
after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison's " psychotics ward " .
assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) .
caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career .ยง
`,
`no , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says " we need to talk about this right now . "
this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems .
director jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs .
it's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) .
it aims to " inspire " rather than to touch hearts .
as yoda would say , inspire it does not .
it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story .
indeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to another character .
this , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence .
i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation .
i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever .
oscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful .

mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect .
a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile .
however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever .
jackie chan plays , who else , jackie .
this time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show .
not that it ever makes a difference in the plot .
there are only two scenes of him cooking .
for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop .
it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ?
a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons .
although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm ,
`,
`
as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape .
this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie .
in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language .
however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases .
strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too .
whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films .
the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons .
but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread .
look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ?
watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts .

one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding .
and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it .
her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 .
but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film .
and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life .
written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor .
alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .
as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting .
walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob .
`,
`
she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown .
and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance .
thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters .
the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family .
ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister .
walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious .
when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , " money versus values . "
ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises .
sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body .
it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight .
lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry .
lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot .
and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure .
`,
`
lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off .
i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed .
the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia .
joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) .
alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet .
the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it .
as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful .
and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .

" the blair witch project " was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses .
its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted .
after the release of " the blair witch project " , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch .
locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , " get out of these woods and go home !
there is no goddamned blair witch ! " .
jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage .
after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet .
as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the " blair witch hunt " .
